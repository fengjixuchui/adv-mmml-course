    Week 2: <strong>Cross-modal interactions</strong> <a href="11877_week2.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What are the different ways in which modalities can interact with each other in multimodal tasks? Can we formalize a taxonomy of such cross-modal interactions, which will enable us to compare and contrast them more precisely? <br/>
    - What are the design decisions (aka inductive biases) that can be used when modeling these cross-modal interactions in machine learning models? <br/>
    - What are the advantages and drawbacks of designing models to capture each type of cross-modal interaction? Consider not just prediction performance, but tradeoffs in time/space complexity, interpretability, etc. <br/>
    - Given an arbitrary dataset and prediction task, how can we systematically decide what type of cross-modal interactions exist, and how can that inform our modeling decisions? <br/>
    - Given trained multimodal models, how can we understand or visualize the nature of cross-modal interactions? <br/>

  topics:
    - What are the types of cross-modal interactions involved to enable such co-learning scenarios where multimodal training ends up generalizing to unimodal testing? <br/>
    - What are some design decisions (inductive bias) that could be made to promote transfer of information from one modality to another? <br/>
    - How do we ensure that during co-learning, only useful information is transferred, and not some undesirable bias? This may become a bigger issue in low-resource settings. <br/>
    - How can we know if co-learning has succeeded? Or failed? What approaches could we develop to visualize and probe the success of co-learning? <br/>
    - How can we formally, empirically, or intuitively measure the additional information provided by auxiliary modality? How can we design controlled experiments to test these hypotheses? <br/>
    - What are the advantages and drawbacks of information transfer during co-learning? Consider not just prediction performance, but also tradeoffs with complexity, interpretability, fairness, etc. <br/>

    Week 13: <strong>Explainability and interpretability</strong> <a href="11877_week13.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What is a taxonomy of multimodal phenomena we should aim to interpret? <br/>
    - In a perfect world, what multimodal information would you expect to be available when interpreting a multimodal model? What multimodal phenomena and characteristics would you want from this “perfect” interpretable model? <br/>
    - What aspects of multimodal interpretability extend beyond the unimodal case? What are the dependencies between unimodal and multimodal interpretability? In other words, what needs to be solved on the unimodal side so that we are successful in multimodal interpretability? <br/>
    - What approaches and techniques can you imagine being best suited for multimodal interpretation? How should we visualize the results of these multimodal interpretations? Black-box model interpretation vs interpretation by design (white-box)? <br/>
    - How can we evaluate that a specific multimodal phenomena (e.g., bimodal interactions) was properly interpreted? How do we measure success in multimodal interpretability? <br/>
    - Separate from model interpretation, there is also the topic of dataset interpretation&#58; characterizing and interpreting the multimodal phenomena present in the data itself, independent of a specific model or prediction task. How can we perform multimodal data interpretation, and are there any differences with multimodal model interpretation? <br/>
    - What is the best way to visualize relatively understudied modalities beyond language and vision? How can we best analyze and characterize the multimodal interactions present between these other modalities? <br/>
    - What are the unique challenges to multimodal explainability, where not only the model is multimodal but also the explanation is potentially multimodal? <br/>

    Week 14: <strong>Multimodal generation and ethical concerns</strong> <a href="11877_week14.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What are some challenges in multimodal generation beyond generating each modality individually? How can we synchronize generation across multiple modalities? <br/>
    - What degree of multimodal modeling is required for these cross-modal generation to be possible? For example, how much do models need to learn regarding cross-modal interactions, alignment, reasoning, etc? <br/>
    - What are the qualities we should consider when evaluating outputs from multimodal generation? What do you think is the best practice to evaluate these qualities? Can we efficiently evaluate these qualities, at scale? <br/>
    - What are the opportunities and challenges of automatic and human evaluation? How can we combine the best of both worlds? <br/>
    - What are the real-world ethical issues regarding generation? How are these risks potentially amplified or reduced when the dataset is multimodal, with heterogeneous modalities? Are there any ethical issues that are specific to multimodal generation? <br/>
    - How can we build a taxonomy of the main ethical concerns related to multimodal generation? <br/>
    - How can we update our best practices to help address these ethical concerns? Who is better placed to start this dialogue? How can we make significant changes in this direction of reducing ethical issues? <br/>

    Week 15: <strong>Generalization, low-resource, and robustness</strong> <a href="11877_week15.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - One general claim is that pre-trained models can help with low-resource settings (e.g., few-shot fine-tuning). What are the multimodal problems where the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning may not generalize? What are the technical challenges? <br/>
    - What are new research paradigms that should be explored to address the challenges of multimodal low-resource problems? Can you propose a taxonomy of the challenges that should be addressed to make progress in this direction, for low-resource modalities? <br/>
    - How can we develop new models that generalize across many modalities (beyond 2 or 3)? What are the tradeoffs between modality-specific multimodal models and general-purpose multimodal models? <br/>
    - What are the commonalities and underlying principles shared across diverse modalities and tasks that can enable good generalization? In other words, what are the pre-requirement for generalization to succeed? <br/>
    - What are the limits of generalization? In other words, in which cases is generalization across modalities and tasks not possible due to possibly to data heterogeneity or some other reasons? What are these scenarios where generalization may not be possible? <br/>
    - How can we perform generalization in the absence of explicit alignment (e.g., paired data) between modalities? How can we tackle the challenges of learning cross-modal interactions, alignment, reasoning, etc? <br/>
    - One other aspect of generalization is with real-world settings where noise is present and modalities may be even missing. How can we robustly handle these noisy situations? How can multimodal help? Can multimodal also make these noisy situations harder? <br/>
